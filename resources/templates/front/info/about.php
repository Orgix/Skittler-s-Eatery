<p class="pb-4">What started in 1980 as a small local eatery, has evolved into a popular fast food business. Skittler's eatery is still growing, with its current size at 13 restaurants. It all started with friends Nikos Tsoynias and Tito Basil when they decided to launch a local neighboorhood hot dog stand. After a year they decided to expand their menu, but they realised that a hot dog stand wouldn't do the job, so they moved their small business to a small shop.</p>

  <p>Today, all Skittler's restaurants serve food to more than four thousand customers daily. We are proud of our service and great food. We are constantly working on creating more delicious meals and improving the existing ones. We know what you want and we've made it faster and easier for you to get it. </p>
